# NWirth
A simple compiler in java using jflex and cup. It supports five data types, three operators types and several statement types including if else, while and do while. 

This compiler was constructed as a partial fulfillment of the course "Programming Languages and Compilers" for the degree of Master's of Engineering in Computer Science at Asian Institute of Technology. It was submitted as an individual project to Prof. Phan Minh Dung.

The language has been named NWirth from the name of Niklaus Wirth, the designer of Pascal and several other languages, as a respect and appreciation for his contributions towards the field of Programming Languages. It is not to be confused with the languages that he designed.

Please read the manual for more details.

#### Acknowledgement:
Foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Dung for introducing me to the field of compilers in a very easy to understand manner, and for always demanding the best effort from all his students. Then, I would like to thank our very helpful TAs Chaichan and Jo for helping me start the project with their tutorials on simple examples. Lastly, I would like to thank my friends Adam, Bishal, Prabina, Satendra and Subash for being wonderful study group mates and being a third eye to debug the program and for providing wonderful memories at, at the time very isolated and quiet SOM Library, AIT.
